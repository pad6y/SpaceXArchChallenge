Hi,

The app starts off on a dummy home page. To consume the api endpoints simply click on the navbar links.

I have decided to use react tool kit for performance purposes. Obviously its a simply app but my reason being is if I were to continue developing this into a bigger site then redux is the way forward.

Setting up took longer then expected. Figuring out what data I want to pull out of the return data. Main pitfall was examining the v3 data rather then the v4 data. v4 data has a more uniform key format. Comparing to v3. So wasted a bit of time there think how to reformat the returned data.

Kept the design simple due to time constraints wasnt sure how long it was gna take.

Ive also decided to reuse the same slice to call each endpoint. I could've created a separate slice to manage the different datasets if it was necessary.

Think thats it?

Anyways Thanks for you time.
Paddy.
